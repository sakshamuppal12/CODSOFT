# 📊 Sales Prediction Using Python

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at CODSOFT**, where I built a machine learning model to predict product sales based on advertising budgets using **Simple Linear Regression**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a predictive model that estimates sales figures based on advertising spend across different media such as **TV**, **Radio**, and **Newspaper**.

---

## 📁 Project Files

- `sales_prediction.ipynb` – Complete Jupyter Notebook with code and output
- `YourDataset.csv` – Dataset used for training and testing the model
- `README.md` – This documentation file

---

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – for machine learning model building

---

## 🔍 Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration** – Imported and explored the dataset
2. **Data Visualization** – Used plots to analyze relationships and trends
3. **Model Training** – Trained a Linear Regression model
4. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluated the model using:
   - **R² Score**
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
5. **Prediction Visualization** – Compared actual vs predicted values visually

---

## 📈 Results

- Built a regression model with **high accuracy** (R² ≈ ~90%)
- Demonstrated a clear relationship between advertising budget and sales
- Gained hands-on experience in machine learning with real-world data
