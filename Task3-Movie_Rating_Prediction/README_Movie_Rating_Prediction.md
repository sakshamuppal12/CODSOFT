# 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at CODSOFT**.  
It uses regression models to predict movie ratings based on features such as Genre, Director, and Duration.

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze historical movie data and build a machine learning model that estimates the IMDb rating of a movie using regression techniques.

## 📁 Files Included

- `movie_rating_prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with complete code
- `IMDb Movies India.csv` – Dataset
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 📊 Dataset Columns Used

- Genre
- Director
- Duration
- Rating (Target variable)

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Handle missing values
3. Convert duration to numeric and standardize
4. Encode categorical features using LabelEncoder
5. Train Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models
6. Evaluate using R² Score and MSE
7. Visualize actual vs predicted ratings

## 📈 Results

- Linear Regression R² Score: ~0.02 (weak prediction)
- Random Forest R² Score: ~-0.003 (underfitting)
- Indicates a need for better feature selection or data enhancement

## 🚀 Internship Task

This is Task 3 for the **CODSOFT Data Science Internship**.  
It demonstrates my ability to apply machine learning on real-world media datasets.
