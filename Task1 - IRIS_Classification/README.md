# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at CODSOFT**.  
It uses the classic Iris dataset to train a model that classifies flowers into **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica**.

## 📁 Files Included

- `iris_classification.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step code
- `IRIS.csv` – Dataset used for training and testing the model
- `README.md` – Project documentation (this file)

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## ✅ Task Objective

Train a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## 📊 Model Used

- Logistic Regression
- Accuracy Achieved: ~97%

## 📌 Internship Details

This task was completed as part of my internship with **CODSOFT**. It demonstrates my ability to handle basic data science problems using Python and machine learning.
